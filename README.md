An over-engineered Pong[-like] game using [an Entity-Component-System engine](https://github.com/darkf/microecs) in C++11

Intro
=====

This is an implementation of a crude approximation of the classic arcade game Pong, implemented in C++11 using the [microecs](https://github.com/darkf/microecs) ECS microframework, using SDL 1.2 to provide basic input and rendering.

Its goal is to show and provide a basic layer for implementing games in this manner.
